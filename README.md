#1. In this activity we have created a Spring Boot application with an H2 Database.

#2. We have created an H2 Database, with a table, and added two rows to it with Java and Spring Data JPA.

#3. To see our data in our H2 Console! clone and open this repository in IntelliJ and click on ‘Maven’ in the right hand side of the screen.

#4. Select h2-zoo > Plugins > spring-boot > springboot:run & double click it.

#5. Once it is up and running, open your browser again and navigate to https://localhost:8080/h2 and connect to our database!

#6. Now, you should be able to see that there is a REPTILE table in our database

#7. If you click reptile, you should see the query ‘SELECT * FROM REPTILE’ appear in the white box. If not, type it in yourself just like that^ and click RUN.

This will show you the reptiles we have entered into the repository!
